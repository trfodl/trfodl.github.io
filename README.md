# Two Rivers Friends of Different Learners

*We are an organization of parents, staff and community members from the Two Rivers area schools working together to enhance the educational opportunities for students who have different learning styles, strengths, abilities and opportunities.*

*Our member groups are based in Colts Neck, Eatontown, Fair Haven, Hazlet, Little Silver, Middletown, Oceanport, Red Bank, Rumson, Shrewsbury, Manasquan, and other nearby NJ communities.*


This site has two purposes: 

* shared calendar for all of our events
* contact information for all of our member groups

Our goal is to provide a landing site for parents and community members who are new to the area or new to the world of different learners.
